Sputnik, a PHP framework built for scalability and performance
---

Sputnik achieves these goals by adhering to the following principles:

- Use extensions instead of PHP libraries;
- Rely on specific infrastructure (like APC) instead of adding layers of abstraction;
- Use as little include files as possible.

Sputnik is created and maintained by ExtendD (www.extendd.nl).
