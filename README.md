# Sputnik, a PHP framework built for scalability and performance

Sputnik achieves its goals by adhering to the following principles:

- Use extensions instead of PHP libraries;
- Rely on specific infrastructure (like APC) instead of adding layers of abstraction;
- Use as little include files as possible;
- Do not rely on output buffering to rewrite content, but push output to the browser asap.

Sputnik is created and maintained by ExtendD (www.extendd.nl).

# Skeleton
The examples/skeleton/ directory contains an example project. You should put the 
contents of the Sputnik library directory (lib/) in the directory lib/sputnik/.
